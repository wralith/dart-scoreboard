# Dart Scoreboard ðŸŽ¯

Only have two versions of `Cricket` game for now.
If a player won a leg, fireworks!! ðŸ¥³

I wanted to try some complex state management in this project. However, it can be easily seperated into parts if its neccessary.

## Setup
```sh
pnpm dev
```

## Stack
- React with Typescript
- Mantine component library
- Fireworks-js for fun

## Todos
- 301/501/701
- Simpler state
- Add Project screenshots to readme
